# Create-A-Style-Guide
Review the style guides listed on the What is a Style Guide? page to get ideas for how the various HTML elements in your interface will look.  Using basic HTML and CSS, create your own style guide web page that consists of the markup and styling for the following elements:

Font
Color Theme
Headings (H1, H2, H3)
Buttons
Form Elements (inputs, checkboxes, radio buttons)
Contextual website messages (Success, Warning, and Error)
Make sure that all elements retain a consistent look and easily communicate their use to the audience.

Your submission should consist of one HTML file and one CSS file.

HTML file should contain a layout of different sections with the markup for each of the listed items above.  This HTML file should contain a link to a CSS file.  The CSS  file should contain the styling for each of the different elements.
